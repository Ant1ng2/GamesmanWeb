GamesmanWeb is a Web-based interface to Gamesman. The main servlet is a 
remote interface to the database and solver, supporting function calls such 
as getMoveValue and getNextMoveValues, which return information about a 
given position for some game and information about the child positions of 
some position, respectively. The client-side interface is written in HTML/CSS 
and JavaScript, allowing it to be viewed in any modern Web browser. This 
package composed of the servlet and client interface is GamesmanWeb.

Requirements
 * Java 5 or newer
 * Ability to compile Gamesman+-
 * A Java application server (e.g., Tomcat, JBoss, WebSphere)

The servlets are JAX-RS service providers and not traditional Java servlets; 
i.e., they do not extend the HttpServlet class. Instead, JAX-RS allows any 
Java class methods to be annotated with HTTP methods and URI paths, and the 
underlying JAX-RS implementation will automatically create URI-to-method 
mappings. The best way to learn is by example in this case; please view 
edu.berkeley.gcweb.servlet.GamesmanServlet for an example.

There is an Ant build script provided, which will compile the necessary 
classes, organize the class files and JAR dependencies into the WAR format, 
and then copy the WAR package to a specified directory. This WAR package 
will be expanded by the application server (e.g., Tomcat).

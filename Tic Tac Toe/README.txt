Tic Tac Toe is currently playable through the command prompt.
The game can be played by compiling and then running java Tictactoe.
Then the player will be prompted to enter their name and choose a 
side (either black or white) and the game can begin. At each step enter
your move by typing in the x, y coordinates into the command prompt, which
will then be executed within the game. For instance to add to the center
of the board, simply type in 1,1. Currently we are still working on trying
to implement animation and graphics through studying the capabilities
of HTML5 Canvas as well as improving web accessibility through JavaScript.

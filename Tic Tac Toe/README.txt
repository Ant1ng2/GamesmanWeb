Tic Tac Toe is currently playable through the command prompt.
The game can be played by compiling and then running java Tictactoe.
Then the player will be prompted to enter their name and choose a 
side (either black or white) and the game can begin. At each step enter
your move by typing in the x, y coordinates into the command prompt, which
will then be executed within the game. For instance to add to the center
of the board, simply type in 1,1. The game will automatically end when 
no more moves are possible or when one side has won.
